### The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells

* Any cell is in one of two possible states, live or dead. 
* Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. 
* At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
 ** Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (referred to as underpopulation).
 ** Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (referred to as overpopulation or overcrowding).
 ** Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.

 ** Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours will come to life.
 
 What you need to do:
 
  * Clone this repo
  * Read the resources file as seed data  for the setup of the first play of the game of life
  * 'Play' the game 5 times including initial set up as a sequence
  * Share the cell state for each play (log or visual) 
If any of these instructions do not make sense - read the wiki and ask questions!
